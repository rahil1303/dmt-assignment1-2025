\section*{Overview}
This repository contains the solution to \textbf{Assignment 1} for the \textit{Data Mining Techniques} course offered at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (2025).

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the practical application of data mining techniques, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    \item Classification using models such as OneR, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees
    \item Regression analysis on numeric targets
    \item Mining association rules
    \item Evaluation of all applied models
\end{itemize}

\section*{Dataset}
We use the \textbf{ODI-2025} dataset, collected from students during the first lecture of the course. It includes self-reported attributes such as stress levels, sleep times, program background, and perceptions of what makes a good day. The dataset supports both classification and regression tasks.

\section*{Structure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{data/} – contains the dataset (Excel/CSV format)
    \item \texttt{notebooks/} – Jupyter notebooks for EDA, classification, and regression
    \item \texttt{src/} – preprocessing and modeling helper scripts
    \item \texttt{reports/} – final report and supporting figures
    \item \texttt{README.md} – general project overview (Markdown)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Team}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Member 1 – Name, student number
    \item Member 2 – Name, student number
    \item Member 3 – Name, student number
\end{itemize}

\section*{Deadline}
